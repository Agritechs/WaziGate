Connect a radio module to Raspberry
===================================

You have to connect a LoRa radio module to the Raspberry's GPIO header. Just connect the corresponding SPI pin (MOSI, MISO, CLK, CS). Of course you also need to provide the power (3.3v) to the radio module. You can have a look at the "Low-cost-LoRa-GW-step-by-step" tutorial in our tutorial repository (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials).

Install the low-level LoRa gateway
==================================

Log as **pi** user on your Raspberry using ssh or connect a display and a keyboard. To get all the low-level LoRa gateway files you can use svn:

https://github.com/Waziup/waziup-gateway

	> svn checkout https://github.com/Waziup/waziup-gateway/trunk/low_level_lora_gw lora_gateway
	
That will create the lora_gateway folder and get all the file of (GitHub) Waziup/waziup-gateway/low_level_lora_gw in it. Then:

	> cd lora_gateway

Note that you may have to install svn before being able to use the svn command:

	> sudo apt-get install subversion
	
Compiling the low-level gateway program
---------------------------------------	 	
    
DO NOT modify the lora_gateway.cpp file unless you know what you are doing. Check the radio.makefile file to indicate whether your radio module uses the PA_BOOST amplifier line or not (which means it uses the RFO line). HopeRF RFM92W/95W or inAir9B or NiceRF1276 or a radio module with +20dBm possibility (the SX1272/76 has +20dBm feature but some radio modules that integrate the SX1272/76 may not have the electronic to support it) need the -DPABOOST. Both Libelium SX1272 and inAir9 (not inAir9B) do not use PA_BOOST. You can also define a maximum output power to stay within transmission power regulations of your country. For instance, if you do not define anything, then the output power is set to 14dBm (ETSI european regulations), otherwise use -DMAX_DBM=10 for 10dBm. Then:

	> make lora_gateway

If you are using a Raspberry v2 or v3 :

	> make lora_gateway_pi2

To launch the gateway

	> sudo ./lora_gateway

On Raspberry v2 or v3 a symbolic link will be created that will point to lora_gateway_pi2.

By default, the gateway runs in LoRa mode 1 and has address 1.

You can have a look at the "Low-cost-LoRa-GW-step-by-step" tutorial in our tutorial repository (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials).

Adding LoRa gateway's post-processing features
==============================================

Look at the "high_level_lora_gateway" folder and follow the README.

Mounting your Dropbox folder
============================

With sshfs:

- look at http://mitchtech.net/dropbox-on-raspberry-pi-via-sshfs/. No need of "sudo gpasswd -a pi fuse" on Jessie.
	
	> sudo apt-get install sshfs
	
- then allow option 'user_allow_other' in /etc/fuse.conf
	
with Dropbox uploader:

- look at http://anderson69s.com/2014/02/18/raspberry-pi-dropbox/
- look at http://raspi.tv/2013/how-to-use-dropbox-with-raspberry-pi
- look at https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader
- but not tested yet and not supported yet

ANNEX.B: Troubleshooting
========================

Verify if the low-level gateway program detects your radio module and if the radio module is working by simply run the low-level gateway program with:

	> sudo ./lora_gateway
	
You should see the following output

	SX1276 detected, starting.
	SX1276 LF/HF calibration
	...
	^$**********Power ON: state 0
	^$Default sync word: 0x12
	^$LoRa mode 1
	^$Setting mode: state 0
	^$Channel CH_10_868: state 0
	^$Set LoRa power dBm to 14
	^$Power: state 0
	^$Get Preamble Length: state 0
	^$Preamble Length: 8
	^$LoRa addr 1: state 0
	^$SX1272/76 configured as LR-BS. Waiting RF input for transparent RF-serial bridge	

If one of the state result is different from 0 then it might be a power/current issue. If the Preamble Length is different from 8 then it can also be a power/current issue but also indicate more important failure of the radio module. Get the "faulty" radio module and connect it to an Arduino board running the interactive end-device sketch. If the Preamble Length is now correct, then retry again with the Raspberry gateway. If the problem on the Raspberry persists, try with another radio module.
	
WARNING
=======

- There is currently no control on the transmit time for both gateway and end-device. When using the library to create devices, you have to ensure that the transmit time of your device is not exceeding the legal maximum transmit time defined in the regulation of your country.

- Although 900MHz band is supported (mostly for the US ISM band), the library does not implement the frequency hopping mechanism nor the limited dwell time.
