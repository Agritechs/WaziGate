create_gwid.sh will be called by start_gw.sh (on boot) to create the gateway id. This is done in order to automatically have a valid gateway id when installing a new gateway with the provided SD card image.

The gateway id SHOULD NOT BE changed from the web admin interface anymore.

Fix the MD5 digest computation. cmd.sh, scripts/basic_gw_config.sh, scripts/config_gw.sh and scripts/create_gwid.sh are changed.
